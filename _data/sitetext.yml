    subtitle: "Computers generate heat"
    text: "<p>The laws of physics require the use of a certain amount of heat in the computation. This is a consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and may not be violated under our current understanding of the laws of physics.</p><p>Further, physics requires that a certain amount of time has to be used in computation. This is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and may not be violated under our current understanding of the laws of physics.</p><p>Using these two principles (the Landauer bound and the Margolus–Levitin limit), we can determine quite accurately how much heat would be released by a computer that brute-forced a 128-bit cipher. The results are profoundly silly: <strong>It's enough to boil the oceans and leave the planet as a charred, smoking ruin.</strong></p><p><strong>Computer processors consume electrical energy, and dissipate this energy in the form of heat. We can definitely assume that 99.99% of the energy that a computer consumes in CPU/GPU/memory and other microchips is converted into heat. Our state of the art technology helps you take advantage of that to  recover and reuse all waste heat.</strong></p>"

        desc: "Our state of the art, **fully synthetic** and best performing [immersion cooling liquid]({{ site.baseurl }}/immersion-cooling/liquid) on the market is Your best choice for Immersion Cooling. It has lowest viscosity, best thermal conductivity, is safe for people and is designed for highest material compatibility. It has superior oxidation and thermal stability, protects from moisture, corrosion, dust and vibrations"

      - title: Cooling Savings
        desc: "A cooling system is one of the most expensive parts of any data center. As energy consumption by cooling data center IT equipment can be over 40% of total energy consumption, efficient cooling for large data centers is essential for reducing operation costs. You can lower drastically amount of energy consumed by Your IT equpment with our Immersion Cooling technology."
        icon: fas fa-wallet

      - title: Higher Cooling Efficiency
        desc: Immersion cooling has been shown to be much more efficient at cooling electronics compared to traditional air cooling methods. This is because the cooling fluid has a much higher heat capacity and thermal conductivity than air, allowing it to absorb more heat and remove it from the components more effectively.
        icon: fas fa-temperature-low

      - title: Reduced Space Requirements
        desc: "Immersion cooling can be more compact than traditional air cooling methods, which can help to reduce the physical footprint of a data center or electronic device."
        icon: fas fa-building

      - title: Increased Reliability
        desc: "Immersion cooling can improve the reliability of electronic components by reducing the likelihood of overheating and thermal stress. This can help to prolong the lifespan of components and reduce the risk of failure."
        icon: fas fa-tools

      - title: Reduced Energy Consumption
        desc: Because immersion cooling is more efficient than traditional air cooling, it can reduce energy consumption and lower the overall operating costs of a data center (even more than 90% of cooling costs can be reduced) or electronic device.
        icon: fas fa-bolt

      - title: Reduced Noise
        desc: Traditional air cooling methods can be VERY noisy, especially in large data centers with many cooling fans. With Immersion cooling technology, whichc doesn't require fans to operate all that noise is removed.
        icon: fas fa-volume-mute

      - title: Environmental Benefits
        desc: Immersion cooling is more environmentally friendly than traditional air cooling methods because it can reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint of a data center or electronic device. With the ability to reuse heat, it is the best option for the highest sustainability.
