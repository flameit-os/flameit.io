Our immersion cooling sea containers are versatile solutions that can be used for various applications, including edge data centers and large-scale crypto mining projects. These containers are designed to provide a cost-effective and efficient cooling solution for high-performance computing hardware, including servers, GPUs, ASICs, and more.

For edge data centers, the smaller 10ft containers can be deployed in remote locations to provide on-site computing power, without the need for expensive and complex cooling infrastructure. The immersion cooling technology used in these containers can reduce cooling costs and increase energy efficiency, making it a practical solution for edge data centers that need to balance performance with cost and energy savings. This method is highly efficient in dissipating heat and can reduce cooling costs by up to 95%.

For larger crypto mining projects, the 20ft and 40ft immersion cooling sea containers can be used to provide high-density computing power, while minimizing energy consumption and operational costs. The containers are designed to withstand the harsh environments and demands of crypto mining operations, while ensuring that the hardware remains cool and stable.

Overall, our immersion cooling sea containers offer a scalable and flexible solution for cooling high-performance computing hardware, regardless of the application or location. By using this innovative technology, businesses and organizations can increase their computing power, while reducing energy consumption, lowering costs, and minimizing their environmental impact.
