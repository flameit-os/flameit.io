Immersion cooling solutions are a cutting-edge technology that allows for highly efficient and effective cooling of server systems. By fully submerging the servers in a non-conductive liquid, heat can be dissipated much more effectively than traditional air-cooling methods, resulting in improved performance, lower energy consumption, and increased reliability.

Our company is proud to offer immersion cooling solutions specifically designed for 19'' rack servers, ensuring that your systems are fully optimized for maximum performance and longevity. Additionally, we are able to deliver new servers that are immersion cooling ready, complete with a comprehensive warranty for added peace of mind. This means that our customers can enjoy the benefits of immersion cooling without the need for costly and time-consuming retrofitting of existing hardware. With our immersion cooling solutions, you can be confident that your server systems are in good hands.
