We are developing most advanced and best [liquid immersion cooling]({{ baseurl }}/immersion-cooling/liquid/) solution
for electronics in the world. We have created the most modern, most innovative and efficient solution that enables many
times more effective cooling of electronic devices by immersing them in our specially designed, fully synthetic,
single-phase liquid.

Compared to air cooling, our solution allows to reduce the overall operating costs of the equipment by several dozen
percent. We are able to reduce the costs of cooling alone by over 95%. Savings come from the fact that no fans and air
conditioning are needed to dissipate heat. The liquid reaches every nook and cranny of the submerged equipment, and for
the operation of the whole thing you only need a pump forcing the heated liquid to the heat exchanger. Recovered waste
heat, in a useful form, can be further used to further increase the profitability of the installation. Flooding with
liquid and removing the fans completely eliminate noise, vibrations, extend the life of the equipment and enable us to
obtain unprecedented computing power.

**Lowering PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) to unprecedented values ≤ 1.03**
