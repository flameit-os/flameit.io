# Immersion Cooling Liquid

Our fully synthetic, **Immersion Cooling liquid** is a revolutionary dielectric cooling product that is designed to provide maximum cooling efficiency and reliability for any electronic device. The liquid is a non-conductive, non-toxic, high temperature flashpoint dielectric fluid that is designed to provide superior cooling performance and reliability. The liquid is designed to be used in direct contact with electronic parts, providing a direct cooling path to the components . This direct cooling path allows for more efficient cooling, as our liquid is able to absorb more than 5 times more heat from the components than air cooling.

Full immersion in coolant is a highly efficient way to keep hardware components cool and clean.

The liquid is able to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the whole system. **No more hot spots causing part melting or fire**.  Additionally, the liquid is designed to **protect from corrosion** which helps to extend the life of devices.

Superior performance of our fully synthetic, thermally conductive and electrically non-conductive (dielectric) immersion cooling fluid allows for highly efficient cooling of your IT equipment. No matter if Your industry is:

* Crypto mining / Blockchain
* Datacenters / Colocation
* Graphics / Rendering
* Government / Banking / Fintech
* Hyperscalers
* Telecommunications
* AI / ML

 Fewer failures rates and easy use of waste heat significantly reduces the operating costs. Cut massively energy consumption and lower carbon footprint of Your  equpment with our tailor-made solutions.
