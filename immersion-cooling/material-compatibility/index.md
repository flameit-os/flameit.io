## Will our liquid work in swimming pool technical room?

* **Question**: One of our customers asked us if he can install our product in swimming pool technical room with where chlorine smell is perceptible? Since our tank is not fully air tight question was if it might have any impac on the fluid itself or whether our fluid can absorbe chlorine from the air?

* **Answear**: Normally the concentration of chlorine in a swimming pool is approximately from 0,5 to 1,0 mg per litre. The chlorine smell is coming from Chloramines solved in the water and doesnâ€™t influence the properties of our fluid.
