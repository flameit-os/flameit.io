But, let briefly talk about history and who was first.

* Before 1887: First electrical systems (transofrmers) were immersed in dielectric fluid.
* 1899: First patent is filed for a "Constant Current Transformer" where oil is mentioned as insulator and coolant [637,773. Patented Nov. 28, 1899. R. FEMING. CONSTANT CURRENT TRANSFORMER. Application fied June 6, 1898].
* 1966: Oktay Sevgin from IBM has made first attempts to liquid cool electronic components using two phase liquid as coolant. [S. Oktay, Multi-liquid Heat Transfer, 555,730, 1968.].
* 1968: Patent for "Immersion Cooling System for Mudularly Packaged Components" is field by another IBM workers: Richard C. Chu and John H. Seely
* 1982: Founder of Cray Research, LLC patented "Immersion cooled high density electronic assembly"
