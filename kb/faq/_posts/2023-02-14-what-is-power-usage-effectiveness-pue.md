**PUE**, or **Power Usage Effectiveness**, is a metric that is used to measure the energy efficiency of a data center. It is calculated by dividing the total amount of energy used by the data center by the energy used by the computing equipment within the data center. A PUE of 1.0 would indicate that all of the energy used by the data center is used by the computing equipment, while a higher PUE would indicate that some of the energy is being used for other purposes, such as cooling or lighting. A lower PUE is desirable because it indicates that a data center is using energy efficiently and not wasting energy on non-computing tasks.
