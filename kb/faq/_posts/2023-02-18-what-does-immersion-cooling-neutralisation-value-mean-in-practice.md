If you're using immersion cooling to keep your servers and other high-performance computing (HPC) equipment cool, you're already ahead of the game. Compared to traditional air or water cooling, immersion cooling is a highly efficient and effective method for dissipating heat from electronic components.

But like any cooling system, the performance of immersion cooling depends on the quality of the cooling liquid. That's where Neutralisation Value (NV) comes in. NV is a measure of the acidity of the insulating oil used in immersion cooling, and it's an important parameter for assessing the condition of the oil.

The NV value is determined by titrating a sample of the oil with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. The titration process measures the amount of KOH required to neutralize the acidic components in the oil, and the resulting NV value is expressed in milligrams of KOH per gram of oil.

In practice, a high NV value indicates a high level of acidity in the oil, which can be caused by contaminants or degradation products. High acidity can cause corrosion, reduce insulation properties, and ultimately reduce the service life of your equipment. A low NV value, on the other hand, indicates that the oil is in good condition and is less likely to cause problems.

So why is NV important for immersion cooling liquid? The answer is simple: the performance of immersion cooling depends on the quality of the cooling liquid. If the liquid is highly acidic, it can corrode the metal components in your equipment, leading to premature failure. It can also degrade the insulation properties of the oil, reducing its ability to dissipate heat.

To ensure that your immersion cooling system is performing at its best, it's important to monitor the NV value of your cooling liquid regularly. By doing so, you can catch any potential problems before they become serious, and take corrective action to replace or purify the oil as needed.
