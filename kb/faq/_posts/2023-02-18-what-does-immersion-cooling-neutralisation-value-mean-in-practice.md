If you're using immersion cooling to keep your servers and other high-performance computing (HPC) equipment cool, you're already ahead of the game. Compared to traditional air or water cooling, immersion cooling is a highly efficient and effective method for dissipating heat from electronic components.

But like any cooling system, the performance of immersion cooling depends on the quality of the cooling liquid. That's where **Neutralisation Value** comes in. Neutralisation Value is a measure of the acidity of the insulating liquid used in immersion cooling, and it's an important parameter for assessing the condition of the liquid.

The **Neutralisation Value** value is determined by titrating a sample of the liquid with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. The titration process measures the amount of KOH required to neutralize the acidic components in the liquid, and the resulting Neutralisation Value value is expressed in milligrams of KOH per gram of liquid.

So why is Neutralisation Value important for [immersion cooling liquid]({{ site.baseurl }}/immersion-cooling/liquid/)? **The answer is simple**: the performance of immersion cooling depends on the quality of the cooling liquid. In practice, a high value indicates a high level of acidity in the liquid, which can be caused by contaminants or degradation products leading to premature failure. High acidity can cause corrosion, reduce insulation properties and ultimately reduce the service life of your equipment. It can also degrade the insulation properties of the liquid, reducing its ability to dissipate heat. A low value, on the other hand, indicates that the liquid is in good condition and is not going to cause any problems.

To ensure that your immersion cooling system is performing at its best, it's important to monitor the Neutralisation Value value of your cooling liquid regularly. By doing so, you can catch any potential problems before they become serious, and take corrective action to replace or purify the liquid as needed.

At our immersion cooling company, we understand the importance of that and the quality of the cooling liquid. That's why we provide highest quality immersion cooling liquid that is strictly designed to deliver best performance and longevity for your electronic equipment.
